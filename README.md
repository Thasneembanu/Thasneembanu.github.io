## Introduction to fablab
  First day of fablab mainly dealt with the introduction to the lab, machines, softwares and methodology used. It also gave an overview about the application of this lab with the needs and inventions of the modern world. The trending design of many models that have been developed using the fablab surprised us.
  ## 3 D printing machine
  Printing a 3 dimensional prototype of a designed product or even a product, can be successfully be done using 3D printing machine. The machine can moved in 3 axes inorder to provide a 3D model. Rhinoceros is one of the software used for the designing of the model and it is then converted into j code by another sofftware known as cura. Then the machine can operates according to the information and design provided  for providing a good model. The material and quality of the material can also be controlled.
